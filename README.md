# work-day-scheduler

## Descritpion 
First I cloned the started code and opened it up in VS code. I modified the Javascript to start with to add a variable of the times of day that would be in the scheduler. I added the past present and future features, so that colors would change accordingly. I added local storage so that data input would be saved even when the page was refreshed. I then edited the html and css slightly so that the title would be in the center of the scheduler.

## Tech Used
